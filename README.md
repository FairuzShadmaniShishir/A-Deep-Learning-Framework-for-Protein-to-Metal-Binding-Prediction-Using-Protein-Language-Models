# ðŸ§¬ A Deep Learning Framework for Protein-to-Metal Binding Prediction Using Protein Language Models

This repository presents an end-to-end deep learning framework to predict protein-to-metal ion binding using modern protein language models. The approach leverages pretrained embeddings from **BioTransformers** and deep learning architectures to identify metal-binding proteins from their amino acid sequences.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

Understanding protein-metal interactions is crucial for many biological functions, including enzymatic catalysis, structural stability, and signal transduction. This project uses transformer-based protein language models to learn sequence-based features and predict whether a given protein binds to metal ions.

## ðŸ§  Key Features

- âœ… Utilizes **BioTransformers** and **Facebook FAIR's ESM models** for robust protein representation.
- âœ… Employs a **deep learning classifier** (TensorFlow) for binary prediction of metal binding.
- âœ… Includes **data preprocessing**, **model training**, and **evaluation** pipelines.
- âœ… Easy-to-run scripts for **reproducibility** and **scalability**.
